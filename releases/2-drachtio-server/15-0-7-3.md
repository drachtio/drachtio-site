* Added support for tagged inbound connections; requires [drachtio-srf@4.3.0](/releases) or above.
* client-server messaging changed from ascii to utf-8 in order to support message bodies with things like emojis.
* various Dockerfile fixes.
* run-time tests added and travis-ci changes to accomodate them.
* sofia-sip has an annoying feature where it forces an outbound request to go out TCP if the packet size exceeds a specific threshold (usually 1300 bytes).  A new configuration setting was added to allow users to increase this threshold to an arbitrary value.  This value can be provided in the configuration file, or via a command-line parameter, as illustrated below.

**in drachtio.conf.xml**
<textarea rows="3" cols="40" style="border:none;">
  <sip>
    <udp-mtu>4096</udp-mtu>
  </sip>
</textarea>

**or, on command-line**
<textarea rows="1" cols="40" style="border:none;">
  drachtio --mtu 4096
</textarea>

* Some clients (e.g. Tandberg) have an annoying habit of included a Route header on an initial INVITE; i.e. a "preloaded" Route header.  When proxying such an INVITE, the server now strips that header before sending the request onwards, so as not to confuse downstream elements.
* Ensure that 'from' tag on new outbound SIP requests use the local tag on the nta leg.  There were cases when an INVITE was challenged that the subsequent INVITE w/ authorization credentials was using the old tag from the completed leg, rather than the new leg created for the second request.
